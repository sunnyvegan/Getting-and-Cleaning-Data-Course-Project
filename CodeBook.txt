The dataset is the activity measurments of 30 people as recorded by a smartphone device. The subjects were randomly assigned to test or training groups.
Linear acceleration and angular velocity was measured by the smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope respectivly. The linear acceleration measurement was broken down into its body and gravity components. The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals

Total number of observations in the dataset: 10299
Total number of variables: 563
